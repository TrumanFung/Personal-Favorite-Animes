# Anime Recommendations and Reviews for People

Anime has been becoming more and more popular recently, so some people might feel inclined yet nervous to begin to watch anime. Yet anime has such a large variety to choose from to watch. There are a lot of good and bad. As someone who as subsumed a lot of Japanese animation for the past 4 years, I thought that I should voice out possible recomendations of anime for people that haven't seen any anime. 

## Action

### One-Punch Man

- action
- sci-fi
- comedy

If you are someone looking for a show with really solid action then One-Punch Man is a solid start for watching Anime. One Punch Man is filled with non stop actions filled with amazing animation. The movement of the characters are really fluid in the fight scences, and the visual effects are also really fluid. About every other episode has action that lives up to the hype and the pacing never slows down. Especially the last fight of season 1 will leave a long lasting impression on every other fight scene afterwards. 

The anime also has solid comedy throughout the show. The comedy that comes from One-Punch Man won't be the greatest comedy that you will find in anime, but it is enough to give a few laughs throughout the show.

Though season 1 lives up to the greatness and hype around One-Punch Man, season 2 will be a serious drop off point. With the change in animation studios, the high octane action and animation took a serious hit. The fluidity and visual effects aren't as great as season 1 used to be. Season 2 begins to build on the world of the other characters and the story of the world, but the action that made One-Punch Man there isn't there. So you really need to watch One-Punch Man Season 1 if you are looking for action in a show.

## Thrillers

### Steins;Gate

- Thriller
- Sci-f

Steins Gate is a solid show that hits every point that it is trying to hit. It is an intense sci-fi thriller, with solid characters that build to a great romance.

### Erased

- Mystery
- Psychological
- Thriller

Since Erased is a story centered anime, I will not be giving a summary. The best way to experience this anime is to go in knowing absolutly nothing about the anime. This shory 12 episode anime tells an intense psychological thriller that gets in heavily invested in the main character and the people he interacts with. Due to its short length of 12 episodes, 

There are plenty of other animes out there for other people to watch. If you want to watch to look for other people's opinion [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) is a great way to see what people like. Because the average person can make an account, the rating aren't the most objective. People often put really extreme answers that don't make sense for the 1-10 rating system. MyAnimeList is not a good reference to see what is objectivly good and well written, but it is a good way to watch know what is popular. What is popular doesn't mean that it isn't objectivly great, but you can get an idea of what is easier for people to watch. 

Ultimately it all begins with the start. Once you start to watch anime, it begins a lot easier to consume more and more anime. Once you find something that you like it becomes even easier. You just need to start.
