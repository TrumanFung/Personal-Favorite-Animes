# Anime Recommendations and Reviews for People

Anime has been becoming more and more popular recently, so some people might feel inclined yet nervous to begin to watch anime. Yet anime has such a large variety to choose from to watch. There are a lot of good and bad. As someone who as subsumed a lot of Japanese animation for the past 4 years, I thought that I should voice out possible recomendations of anime for people that haven't seen any anime. 

## Action

### One-Punch Man

![onepunchman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/9/93/One-Punch_Man.jpg)

- **action**
- **sci-fi**
- **comedy**

If you are someone looking for a show with really solid action then One-Punch Man is a solid start for watching Anime. One Punch Man is filled with non stop actions filled with amazing animation. The movement of the characters are really fluid in the fight scences, and the visual effects are also really fluid. About every other episode has action that lives up to the hype and the pacing never slows down. Especially the last fight of season 1 will leave a long lasting impression on every other fight scene afterwards. 

The anime also has solid comedy throughout the show. The comedy that comes from One-Punch Man won't be the greatest comedy that you will find in anime, but it is enough to give a few laughs throughout the show.

Though season 1 lives up to the greatness and hype around One-Punch Man, season 2 will be a serious drop off point. With the change in animation studios, the high octane action and animation took a serious hit. The fluidity and visual effects aren't as great as season 1 used to be. Season 2 begins to build on the world of the other characters and the story of the world, but the action that made One-Punch Man there isn't there. So you really need to watch One-Punch Man Season 1 if you are looking for action in a show.

### Mob Psycho 100

- **Action**
- **Comedy**
- **Slice of Life**

Mob Psycho 100 hits all the same action pluses that One Punch Man hits. The story follows Mob, a natural psychic that has a hard time controlling his power because of his emotions. Done by studio bones, Mob Psycho 100 is a beautifully well done action masterpiece. The action of Mob Psycho is always great to watch because animate most of the foreground and the background. Additionally, because the art style is so bright, it becomes alot easier to take in all the details of the battles. The action has people flying around environments with insane camera pans that add to the depth of the fight. The actions sequences of Mob Psycho never cease to dissapoint throughout season 1 and season 2.

Despite the amazing action, the story is more so about Mob's journey of self discovery than it is about the action. Mob slowly learns the values of what it means to work hard in life, no matter how different people's power and status are. Mob learns this more and more through his encounters with other people. The message isn't the most convoluted, but it leaves a mark after experiencing Mob's journey.

The biggest flaw about this anime is the art-style. This characters looks nothing like modern anime and the whole look is very cartoony. Most would feel perturbed by the cartoony look of the anime, but once you get past it the anime becomes amazing. The art-style doesn't decrease the quality of the anime at all. In fact, because of the simplicity of the character designs, it allows the animation studio to do crazier fight scenes. Once you get past the art-style and watch the anime, you find yourself having a great time.

## Thrillers

### Steins;Gate

- **Thriller**
- **Sci-f**

Steins Gate is a solid show that hits every point that it is trying to hit. It is an intense sci-fi thriller, with solid writing that gives each character unique traits and interactions with other characters. Without spoiling too much, the show follows Okabe on a time traveling journey to fix a major issue that he can't seem to overcome. 

The witty dialouge that Okabe and Kurisu, the female protagonist, have can only be found within the english dub of the anime. Generally, watching between the japanese or english language is a preference, but for Steins;Gate, it is actually better with the English voice actors. Not only do the voice actors perfectly bring out the life in the characters, but the writing that was changed in the english version was made for the better. The pacing and variety in the dialouge for the characters is like that of writing in actual books. The writing isn't filled with the normal trite dialouge of anime, but contains dialouge that illustrates the intelligence and wit behind the characters. 

The show also has a very solid and thoughtout sci-fi element. The time travel isn't the most perfect explanation of time-travel, as with most time travel stories, but the explanation of time travel and how he uses it to solve certain conflicts is more than enough to be invested in the show. For the most part, the time travel explained makes sense and they don't leave too many large loop holes that make you question the time travel element.

The biggest problem with the show is the pacing. The first half of the show has a really slow start to the main conflict of the story. Once the main conflict hits, the pacing becomes emmaculate. Every next episode adds more story and builds upon more suspense. There is always either a big reveal or a big cliffhanger. Every episode plays its part to add to the greater whole. The first half isn't bad by any means, but the pacing is slow enough to were it might draw people away from finishing the show. Once one gets past the first half, the show feels like an absolute masterpiece.

### Erased

![erasedimage](https://img.paratic.com/dosya/2017/03/en-iyi-animeler-erased-boku-dake-ga-inai-machi.jpg)

- **Mystery**
- **Psychological**
- **Thriller**

Since Erased is a story centered anime, I will not be giving a summary. The best way to experience this anime is to go in knowing absolutly nothing about the anime. This shory 12 episode anime tells an intense psychological thriller that gets in heavily invested in the main character and the people he interacts with. Due to its short length of 12 episodes, its pacing is phenomenal. Every episode has a cliffhanger that adds unto the mystery of the story. You constantly wonder about the overarching mystery and how the main character will solve it.

Another great thing about this anime is how it touches upon people's psyche. One of the characters has an incredibly complelling backstory which makes you more invested in the resolution of the story. The anime addresses some topics that could be considered disturbing, but the topics add a greater gravitos to the stories progression. All the aspects that the anime try to convey are properly convey in a excellent way.

I wish that I could talk more about what makes the anime so good, but that might away too much in the story. The whole greatness predicated behind this anime is the fact that it is a Mystery. The fact that you are unsure about everything is what makes this anime so good.

## What to Take Away

There are plenty of other animes out there for other people to watch. If you want to watch to look for other people's opinion [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) is a great way to see what people like. Because the average person can make an account, the rating aren't the most objective. People often put really extreme answers that don't make sense for the 1-10 rating system. MyAnimeList is not a good reference to see what is objectivly good and well written, but it is a good way to watch know what is popular. What is popular doesn't mean that it isn't objectivly great, but you can get an idea of what is easier for people to watch. 

Remember that this is all my opinion for what to start with for watching anime. These are my opinion on certain anime what would be good to start off with to get into watching anime. They may not be the best for everyone and they may also not be as good as some other people think. You can like what you watch and that is perfectly fine.

Ultimately it all begins with the start. Once you start to watch anime, it begins a lot easier to consume more and more anime. Once you find something that you like it becomes even easier. You just need to start.
